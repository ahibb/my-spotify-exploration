# Spotify Insights

A data science project that explores how my personal music tastes have changed over time based on my Spotify playlists. 

## About
I was inspired to start this project when I realized I had been creating monthly/seasonal playlists in Spotify since 2018. I thought this project would be a good opportunity to explore how, if at all, my music tastes have evolved or changed in 2018 while also gaining some new skills.

## Requirements
* Python 3.7 or later
* A Spotify developer account
* Registered app in your Spotify developer account (client secret and client id)
